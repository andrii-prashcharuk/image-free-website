# Image-Free Website
This project was created to show how powerful web technologies are. All the
graphics here are SVG and HTML elements embedded in the source code what
means they are small and doesnâ€™t required additional requests to the server.
The web page is 100% responsive and looks great on mobile and desktop devices.
The size of the compiled project is 365KB only!
